### Event-Driven Orchestration as Core Pattern

The FlowOrchestrator system implements event-driven orchestration as its core architectural pattern:

- **Event-Based Flow Progression**: Flow execution advances through a series of events
- **Message-Driven Communication**: Components communicate through well-defined messages
- **Centralized Orchestration**: The Orchestrator Service coordinates event flow
- **Decentralized Processing**: Individual services handle specific processing responsibilities
- **Event-Based State Transitions**: System state changes in response to specific events

## 1.2 Core Principles

### 1.2.1 Stateless Design
- Services do not depend on previous states
- Enhances reliability and scalability
- Exception: memory services maintain state
- Orchestrator maintains state of flow execution across stateless processors
- Services can be restarted without loss of system integrity
- Enables horizontal scaling and load balancing
- Simplifies recovery from service failures
- Promotes clean separation of concerns

### 1.2.2 Message-Based Communication
- Services connect through a shared message pipeline
- Messages are sent and received between components
- Messages contain routing information for data placement in shared memory
- Task Scheduler directly initiates data import via messages to the Importer Service
- Orchestrator Service provides initial execution context to Task Scheduler
- Orchestration logic is centralized in the Orchestrator Service after import completion
- Provides loose coupling between system parts
- Supports various connection protocols between system and external sources/destinations

### 1.2.3 Shared Memory Model
- Central cache serves as shared memory
- Services write to and read from the cache based on orchestrator instructions
- Memory locations are assigned dynamically by the Orchestrator Service
- Hierarchical naming pattern ensures unique and traceable data storage
- Used for passing data between processing steps
- Enables efficient data transfer without serialization/deserialization overhead
- Branch-specific memory locations ensure isolation between parallel execution paths

### 1.2.4 Data Storage Strategy
- Information stored in key-value dictionary
- Data structures mapped by hierarchical naming convention
- Format: {executionId}:{flowId}:{stepType}:{branchPath}:{stepId}:{dataType}
- Enables efficient access and retrieval
- Maintains clear separation between different flow executions
- Facilitates data lifecycle management and cleanup
- Supports branch isolation and merge operations

### 1.2.5 Version Control
- All system components maintain version information
- Version identifiers follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Component versions are immutable once created
- Changes to components require creating new versions
- Version compatibility is enforced during flow construction and execution
- Version history is maintained for all components
- Version status transitions (ACTIVE → DEPRECATED → ARCHIVED) are tracked

## 1.3 System Benefits

### 1.3.1 Scalability
- Stateless services scale horizontally
- Can handle increased processing loads
- Components can be distributed across resources
- Dynamic service allocation based on workload

- Adaptable to varying load patterns

### 1.3.2 Flexibility
- Components can be added, removed, or modified
- Changes to one component don't affect others
- Supports evolving business requirements
- Message-based orchestration enables dynamic flow adjustments
- Branch-based processing enables complex transformation patterns
- Versioning allows controlled evolution of system components
- Multiple protocol support through specialized implementations
- Configuration-driven behavior modification

### 1.3.3 Reliability

## 1.5 Solution Structure

### 1.5.1 Single Solution Approach

The FlowOrchestrator system will be implemented as a single Visual Studio solution containing multiple projects. This monorepo architecture provides several significant benefits:

1. **Centralized Development**: All code is maintained in a single repository, simplifying version control, continuous integration, and deployment processes.

2. **Simplified Dependencies**: Project references between components are managed directly within the solution, ensuring consistent versioning and eliminating version conflicts.

3. **Shared Code Reuse**: Common libraries, interfaces, and abstract classes can be easily shared across all microservices without duplication.

4. **Coordinated Testing**: Integration and system testing can be performed across all components simultaneously, ensuring proper interaction between services.

5. **Unified Build Process**: The entire system can be built, tested, and deployed from a single pipeline, streamlining DevOps processes.

### 1.5.2 Solution Organization

### 1.5.3 Project Type Organization

The solution projects are organized into the following categories:

#### Core Projects
Core projects contain the fundamental abstractions, interfaces, and models used throughout the system:

- **Class Libraries**: Fundamental abstractions, interfaces, and domain models
  - `FlowOrchestrator.Abstractions`: Core interfaces and abstract classes for all services
  - `FlowOrchestrator.Domain`: Domain models and entities
  - `FlowOrchestrator.Common`: Shared utilities and helpers

#### Domain Service Projects
Domain service projects implement specific microservices organized by their domain:

- **Web API Projects**: Services with external REST API endpoints
  - `FlowOrchestrator.Orchestrator`: Orchestrator Service
  - `FlowOrchestrator.FlowManager`: Flow Manager
  - `FlowOrchestrator.ServiceManager`: Service Manager
  - `FlowOrchestrator.ConfigurationManager`: Configuration Manager
  - `FlowOrchestrator.VersionManager`: Version Manager
  - `FlowOrchestrator.StatisticsService`: Statistics Service
  - `FlowOrchestrator.MonitoringFramework`: Monitoring Framework
  - `FlowOrchestrator.AnalyticsEngine`: Analytics Engine

- **Worker Service Projects**: Background services without external REST APIs
  - `FlowOrchestrator.MemoryManager`: Memory Manager
  - `FlowOrchestrator.BranchController`: Branch Controller
  - `FlowOrchestrator.TaskScheduler`: Task Scheduler
  - `FlowOrchestrator.AlertingSystem`: Alerting System
  - All protocol-specific importers and exporters

#### Infrastructure Projects
Infrastructure projects provide the technical foundation for the system:

- **MongoDB Integration**: Data persistence infrastructure
- **Hazelcast Integration**: In-memory data grid infrastructure
- **MassTransit Integration**: Messaging infrastructure
- **Quartz.NET Integration**: Scheduling infrastructure
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Observability infrastructure

### 1.5.4 Project Dependencies

Project dependencies will follow strict layering principles to prevent circular dependencies:

1. **Core Projects**: Have no dependencies on other FlowOrchestrator projects
2. **Domain Service Projects**: Depend on Core projects and Infrastructure projects
3. **Infrastructure Projects**: Depend only on Core projects
4. **Test Projects**: Depend on the projects they are testing and test infrastructure

Dependencies between domain service projects will be minimized, with communication primarily occurring through well-defined interfaces and messaging.

### 1.5.5 Deployment Independence

Despite being part of a single solution, each microservice will maintain deployment independence:

1. **Containerization**: Each microservice will be containerized individually
2. **Configuration**: Each microservice will have its own configuration
3. **Versioning**: Each microservice will be versioned independently
4. **Scaling**: Each microservice can be scaled independently
5. **Deployment**: Each microservice can be deployed independently

This approach maintains the benefits of microservice architecture while simplifying development and ensuring consistency.

### 1.5.6 Microservice Boundaries

To maintain clear boundaries between microservices despite the single solution:

1. **Explicit Interfaces**: All inter-service communication goes through explicit interfaces
2. **Message-Based Communication**: Services communicate via messages, not direct method calls
3. **Database Isolation**: Each service has logical isolation in the database
4. **No Shared State**: Services do not share mutable state except through the defined memory manager
5. **Independent Configuration**: Each service has its own configuration

These boundaries ensure that the system maintains the benefits of a microservice architecture while simplifying development through the single solution approach.
