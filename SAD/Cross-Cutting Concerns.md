        "componentType": "SourceEntity",
        "versionRange": "2.0.0-2.1.5",
        "notes": "Native v2 protocol support"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4.1.4 Version Lifecycle Management

The version lifecycle in FlowOrchestrator follows a well-defined path:

1. **Creation**: A new version is created and registered
2. **Active**: The version is available for use in flows
3. **Deprecated**: The version is marked for future removal but still operational

	## 4.5 Recovery Framework

The recovery framework provides comprehensive capabilities for recovering from system failures and ensuring business continuity.

### 4.5.1 Manager Recovery Architecture

- **Registry Persistence Mechanism**:
  - All Service Managers persist their registries to a distributed, redundant storage system
  - Registry snapshots are created at configurable intervals (default: 5 minutes)
  - Transaction logs capture all registry modifications between snapshots
  - Registry data is stored in a versioned format to enable point-in-time recovery
  - Each record includes metadata for recovery validation (timestamps, checksums, version information)
  - Storage system implements replication with quorum-based consistency

- **Manager State Recovery Process**:
  - Managers implement a standardized recovery sequence:
    1. **Initialization Recovery**: Load last stable registry snapshot
    2. **Transaction Replay**: Apply transaction logs to reach most recent valid state
    3. **Consistency Verification**: Validate internal state consistency
    4. **Cross-Manager Validation**: Verify cross-dependencies with other managers
    5. **Recovery Notification**: Signal recovery completion to dependent components
  - Recovery operations are transactional with rollback capabilities
  - Registry recovery includes version compatibility validation
  - Failed recovery attempts trigger escalating recovery strategies

### 4.5.2 Service Recovery Architecture

- **Service State Persistence**:
  - Services maintain minimal persistent state in accordance with stateless design
  - Service configuration and version information is persisted
  - ServiceStateRepository stores recoverable lifecycle information
  - Critical runtime state is checkpointed to persistent storage at configurable intervals
  - State persistence implementation uses write-ahead logging for consistency

- **Service Recovery Process**:
  - Services implement the IRecoverable interface with standardized recovery methods:
    ```
    interface IRecoverable {
      RecoveryStatus InitiateRecovery(RecoveryContext context);
      ValidationResult ValidateRecoveryState();
      RecoveryOptions GetRecoveryStrategies();
      RecoveryMetrics GetLastRecoveryStatistics();
    }
    ```
  - Recovery process includes:
    1. **Instance Recreation**: New service instance is created
    2. **Configuration Restoration**: Service configuration is restored from persistent storage
    3. **State Initialization**: Service transitions to INITIALIZED state
    4. **Dependency Validation**: Service validates all required dependencies
    5. **Readiness Check**: Service verifies operational readiness
    6. **Activation**: Service transitions to READY state

### 4.5.3 Orchestrator Service Recovery

- **State Persistence Strategy**:
  - Orchestrator Service implements comprehensive state persistence:
    - Active flow execution contexts are checkpointed to persistent storage
    - Branch states and progress are recorded in a recoverable format
    - The Active Resource Address Registry is persisted with each state update
    - Message routing decisions are journaled for replay
    - Memory address allocations are tracked in persistent storage
    - Error handling contexts are preserved for recovery continuity

- **Distributed Orchestration Model**:
  - Primary-Secondary orchestration with automatic failover
  - State replication occurs synchronously for critical operations
  - Secondary instances maintain warm standby state
  - Quorum-based leader election for orchestrator high availability
  - Client connections automatically redirect to active orchestrator
  - Orchestrator cluster maintains global execution state consistency

- **Flow Execution Recovery**:
  - Three-tier recovery strategy for in-flight flows:
    1. **Full Continuation**: Flows with complete checkpoint data resume from last checkpoint
    2. **Partial Recovery**: Flows with incomplete checkpoint data resume from recoverable branches
    3. **Clean Restart**: Flows without sufficient recovery data are restarted

### 4.5.4 Recovery Strategy Selection

The Recovery Framework implements intelligent strategy selection based on multiple factors:

- Component criticality classification
- Current system load and health
- Available resources for recovery
- Historical recovery performance data
- Dependency state and availability
- Data consistency requirements
- Configured recovery priorities

Recovery strategies include:

- **Progressive Recovery**: Incremental restoration of functionality
- **Partial Service Recovery**: Restore critical functions first
- **Dependency-Aware Recovery**: Coordinate recovery based on dependency graph
- **Prioritized Flow Recovery**: Recover high-priority flows first
- **Compensating Recovery**: Apply compensating actions for unrecoverable operations
- **Client-Transparent Recovery**: Hide recovery details from client systems

### 4.3.3 Configuration Hierarchy

The system supports a multi-level configuration hierarchy:

1. **System-Level Configuration**: Global settings that apply to all components
2. **Service-Type Configuration**: Default settings for all instances of a service type
3. **Service-Instance Configuration**: Settings specific to a service instance
4. **Flow-Level Configuration**: Settings that apply to a specific flow
5. **Execution-Time Configuration**: Dynamic settings applied at runtime

### 4.3.4 Configuration Storage

Configuration data is stored in a structured repository:

- Versioned configuration storage
