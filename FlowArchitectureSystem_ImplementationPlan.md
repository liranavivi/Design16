# Flow Architecture System Implementation Plan (Fresh Start)

This implementation plan outlines a fresh start approach for the Flow Architecture System based on the abstract classes and interfaces defined in the UML view. The plan is structured to support a phased implementation approach with a focus on microservices architecture and appropriate service types for different components.

## Implementation Approach

Starting from scratch, we will follow these guiding principles:

1. **Microservices First**: Design with microservices architecture from the beginning
2. **Appropriate Service Types**: Use the right service type for each component (Worker Services for background processing, Web APIs only where needed)
3. **Incremental Development**: Build and test incrementally, starting with core components
4. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipeline early in the process
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside implementation

## Incremental Build Process

For each component implementation, we will follow this enhanced incremental build process:

1. **Research & Documentation Review Phase** (internal preparation, not to be displayed in implementation plan):
   - Review the Implementation Approach section of this plan
   - Review the Incremental Build Process section of this plan
   - Document understanding of how these apply to the current component
   - Review existing documentation and UML diagrams
   - Research best practices and patterns for the component
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Create a detailed implementation checklist
   - Prepare to provide a comprehensive summary before implementation

2. **Preview Planning Phase**:
   - Create a detailed preview plan for the specific component
   - Identify potential challenges and solutions
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Estimate effort and timeline more precisely
   - Develop detailed step-by-step implementation instructions
   - Provide high-level descriptions of implementation requirements
   - Define verification points for each implementation step
   - Get approval for the preview plan before proceeding

3. **Design Phase**:
   - Check for existing implementations or duplicates before creating new abstractions
   - Verify that the component doesn't already exist in the codebase
   - Place common structures (classes, enums, interfaces) in the common library
   - Reference the common library from other projects rather than duplicating structures
   - Define interfaces and contracts
   - Create class diagrams
   - Document expected behavior
   - Ensure alignment with the overall architecture

4. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Before implementation, search the codebase for similar components to avoid duplication
   - Identify which components should be placed in the common library
   - Place all shared structures (classes, enums, interfaces) in the common library
   - Reference the common library from other projects rather than duplicating structures
   - Implement the component according to design
   - Build the solution after each significant change
   - Address any build errors immediately
   - Do not proceed to new features until current code builds cleanly
   - Follow coding standards and best practices
   - Document any decisions made to avoid duplication

5. **Build Verification Phase**:
   - Perform a clean build of the entire solution
   - Verify all components compile together
   - Address any remaining build warnings
   - Ensure build performance is acceptable

6. **Testing Phase**:
   - Write unit tests for the component
   - Run unit tests and fix any failures
   - Measure code coverage and improve if needed
   - Perform static code analysis

7. **Integration Phase**:
   - Integrate the component with related components
   - Run integration tests
   - Address any integration issues
   - Verify compatibility with existing components

8. **Review Phase**:
   - Conduct code review
   - Refactor code based on feedback
   - Document any design decisions or changes
   - Ensure compliance with architectural guidelines

9. **Progress Update Phase**:
   - Update implementation plan with actual progress
   - Document any lessons learned
   - Adjust timeline if necessary
   - Update documentation to reflect implementation details

This enhanced process will be applied to each component in the implementation plan, ensuring that we maintain a working solution at all times, can detect and address issues early, and that each implementation step is well-informed by existing documentation and carefully planned before execution.

## Important Implementation Requirements

**Before starting any implementation task:**

1. **Review the Implementation Approach section** to ensure alignment with the overall implementation philosophy and guiding principles (do not display this review in the implementation plan).

2. **Review the Incremental Build Process section** to understand the detailed steps required for each component implementation (do not display this review in the implementation plan).

3. **Document your understanding** of how these principles and processes apply to the specific component you are implementing (for internal use only, not to be included in the implementation plan).

4. **Provide a Summary of the Step Plan** that includes:
   - Clear objectives for the implementation step
   - List of components to be implemented
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Expected outcomes and deliverables
   - Timeline and effort estimates

5. **Detail the Implementation Steps** with:
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions without code implementation
   - High-level description of what needs to be implemented
   - Verification step to check for duplicates before creating new abstractions/interfaces
   - Analysis of which components should be placed in the common library
   - Strategy for referencing common components rather than duplicating them
   - Expected results for each step
   - Verification points to ensure correctness
   - Potential issues and mitigation strategies

These reviews and planning steps must be conducted before each implementation task to ensure consistency in approach, clear communication, and high quality across all components.

**Note on Implementation Plan Display**: When presenting the implementation plan, only include the "Summary of the Step Plan" and "Implementation Steps" sections. Do not include the Implementation Approach Review, Incremental Build Process Review, or any code implementation details.

**Important Note on Duplicate Prevention**: Before creating any new abstractions, interfaces, or components, always verify that a similar component doesn't already exist in the codebase. This includes:
1. Searching the entire codebase for similar naming patterns
2. Reviewing existing abstractions and interfaces for potential reuse
3. Consulting with team members about existing components
4. Documenting the verification process and findings
5. Checking if the structure (class, enum, interface) already exists in any project
6. Ensuring all common structures are placed in the common library to avoid duplication
7. Referencing the common library from other projects rather than recreating structures

## Common Library Usage

The FlowArchitecture.Common project serves as the central repository for shared structures and utilities used across the entire system. Following these guidelines will ensure proper usage:

1. **What belongs in the Common library**:
   - Data structures used by multiple projects
   - Utility classes and extension methods
   - Shared enums and constants
   - Common interfaces that don't belong to a specific layer
   - Helper classes and common functionality

2. **Common Library Usage Guidelines**:
   - Always check the Common library first before creating a new structure
   - Place any structure that will be used by multiple projects in the Common library
   - Reference the Common library from other projects instead of duplicating code
   - Keep the Common library focused on truly shared components
   - Avoid circular dependencies by ensuring the Common library doesn't reference other projects

3. **Process for Adding to Common Library**:
   - Verify the component doesn't already exist in the Common library
   - Determine if the component is truly shared across multiple projects
   - Design the component to be generic and reusable
   - Document the component thoroughly
   - Add appropriate unit tests for the component

## Implementation Phases

The implementation will be divided into the following phases:

1. **Project Setup** - Solution structure, project creation, and CI/CD setup
2. **Core Layer** - Core interfaces, abstract classes, and basic data structures
3. **Service Layer** - Service implementations and managers
4. **Protocol Layer** - Protocol implementations and handlers
5. **Entity Layer** - Entity implementations and managers
6. **Infrastructure Layer** - Data access and messaging infrastructure
7. **Hosting Layer** - Worker services and APIs
8. **Integration Layer** - System integration and orchestration
9. **UI Layer** - Administrative UI
